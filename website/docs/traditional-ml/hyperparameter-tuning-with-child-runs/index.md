# Hyperparameter Tuning with MLflow and Optuna {#hyperparameter-tuning-with-mlflow-and-optuna}

In this guide, we venture into a frequent use case of MLflow Tracking:
hyperparameter tuning.

Our journey will begin with a detailed notebook that showcases
hyperparameter tuning using Optuna, and how each of these tuning runs
are logged seamlessly with MLflow. Following this, we'll delve deeper,
exploring alternative APIs and techniques that can be leveraged to
further enhance our model tracking capabilities.

Throughout this guide, our focal points will be:

-   Introducing the capabilities of MLflow for tracking hyperparameter
    tuning
-   Understanding the distinction between parent and child runs in
    MLflow
-   Delving into the components of MLflow and their relevance in our
    workflow
-   Discovering and navigating experiments, parent runs, and child runs
    in the MLflow UI
-   Conducting a comparative analysis of runs to understand the nuances
    of hyperparameter tuning
