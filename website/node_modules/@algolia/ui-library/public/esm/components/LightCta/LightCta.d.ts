/** `LightCta` is a type of link component. It's got unique styling with an arrow icon and a leading tail line, though both can be disabled if so desired.
 * It's also worth mentioning that the tail has to be actively enabled if desired.

 * The `LightCta` is primarily used in place of `Button` where you'd want less emphasis, while still keeping some flair to attract attention.

 * The "tail" variation can be triggered from a parent element by applying a `data-with-tail-cta` attribute on the element.
