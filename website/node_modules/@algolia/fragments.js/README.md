**Fragments.js** is a Nodejs implementation of [Fragments.css](https://github.com/algolia/fragments.css), an atomic css framework that aims to make developers' lives easier.

## Made for all usecases

One of the advantages of choosing **Fragments.js** to build your UIs is that it's fully customizable from one and only entry point. Head to the `fragments.config.js` and adjust the template with your own colors, fonts and styles, which will then be propogated to the compiled CSS.

## Using Fragments.js

_Note that we're using yarn for these examples, but you can of course use the npm equivalent._

### Getting started

```bash
yarn add @algolia/fragments.js
```

To initialise the `fragments.config.js`, run the following:

```bash
fragments init
```

Make sure to edit the newly created `fragments.config.js` file in your root directory, after which you can run:

```bash
fragments build [destination]
```

This will output `fragments.css` with your configuration, into the destination folder, which defaults to `/dist`.

If you're having troubles making it work and getting `command not found`, try running the command using either `node_modules/.bin/fragments <command> [options]` or [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

### Versions

Do your edits, then:

- Open a new pull request from the branch holding your changes to `master`

Once your PR has been merged:

- `git checkout master && git pull origin master`
- Bump the version in the package.json
- `npm publish`
- `git add . && git commit -m"bumped version <version>" && git push origin master`

If you edited the docs:

- `yarn docs:build`

### Usage

Example usage in React:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import '~/dist/fragments.css';

const App = () => (
  <div className="bgc-cosmos">
    <p className="color-white fsz-24 ta-center">
      Hello world, using <b>Fragments.js</b>
    </p>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```
